= Novastar Controller

This repo stores scripts used to control NovaStar controllers without using the clumsy and error-prone interface.
The scripts can then be used to be triggered by shortcuts or a streamdeck using the https://www.elgato.com/de/stream-deck[offical software] or https://bitfocus.io/companion/[companion].

The scripts work by sending the TCP packets straigth to the controller. 
The values were found out by sniffing the network using https://www.wireshark.org/#download[Wireshark].

== Finding fader values

The values were sniffed by using the following filter: 
_(replace `ip.dst` and `tcp.port` with according values)_
----
ip.dst==192.168.0.78 && tcp.port == 5200 && frame.len == 75 
----

They were afterwards exported as JSON and filtered out on the `tcp.payload` fields.

=== Match the payloads to screens

Since our configuration features two screens, the packets sniffed always came in a pair.
The payload was then pasted into a spreadsheet. 
The pair was then assigned to even and uneven rhythm.
The indices of the columns were then pasted into different columns and the right assignment was done using the `indirect` function from the spreadsheet.
The mapping was done by trial and error.
The example file can be found xref:fader/LED-Side-Panels-Values.xlsx[here].
